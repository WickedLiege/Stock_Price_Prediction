# Stock_Price_Prediction

I developed a Regression Model using a Neural network architecture to forecast and predict future prices of a specific stock. The model accurately predicts the stock price of the 61st day based on the previous 60 days' stock prices. Using the LSTM architecture and incorporating Dropout and Dense layers with suitable activation functions, the model achieved a respectable R-squared value of 0.769. To analyze the model's performance, I plotted the Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss against the number of Epochs, providing insights into the convergence and optimization of the model during training. Additionally, I compared the Actual Stock prices with the Predicted Stock prices over time, visually evaluating the model's ability to capture the stock price trends accurately. These evaluations and visualizations contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the model's forecasting capabilities and its performance in predicting stock prices.
